This will start **jtop**, which will display real-time information about your Jetson Nano's CPU/GPU usage, memory, and more.

## Step 5: Updating Jetson-Stats

If you need to update **jtop** or the **jetson-stats** package in the future, use the following command:

```bash
sudo -H pip3 install -U jetson-stats
```

This command will ensure that you always have the latest version.
